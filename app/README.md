### Notes
- Two-page login/registration process. No frills, no nothing
    - Email + password 
        - FUTURE: Google/FB login
    - In case of registration, inputting the four main lifts
        - FUTURE: 1RM calculator based on 1-10RM max. Plenty of formulas online. Maybe implement three and display the average?

- Click a button to open the workout.
- User then gets taken to a screen that shows a every rudimentary summart of the coming workout
    - What body parts, what accessories
        - FUTURE: Show estimated length based on previous workout logs
- When workout starts, user gets taken to 'start of exercise'-screen. On it, the user is shown what plates they'll need for the upcoming lifts (i.e. 6x20kgs, 2x10kgs, 2x2.5kg, and 2x1.25kgs)
    - FUTURE: Add support for fractional plates?

- Styling should be dark-mode first
- Set a 2-week deadline for initial prototype
- Make it a feature, not an app
